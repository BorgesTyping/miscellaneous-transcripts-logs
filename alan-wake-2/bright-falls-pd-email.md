# Abridged Bright Falls Police Department e-mail transcript

There is a specific e-mail that I wanted to manually transcribe, as I currently don't own a copy of
[*Alan Wake II*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Wake_2).  Also, I brought up this specific 
e-mail from the game in conversation with a friend, because the game's story plot is off-the-rails,
though surprisingly almost everything else about the game is actually well-grounded in IRL reality
(ironic, given the plot involved reshaping the story's reality) and academic research.

There's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgL99_0cihQ&t=251s) (which is timestamped) on
Remedy Entertainment's YouTube channel that mentions how the creative team 3D scanned actual trees
from the Pacific Northwest to use as video game assets, so I'm not surprised that this also holds
true for the rest of the world building.

In the penultimate e-mail Saga examines on the Bright Falls PD computer, before opening the last
e-mail that progresses the story forward (after the electricity is restored but before the Scratch
boss fight starts in the Bright Falls PD parking lot), there is an e-mail that caught my attention.
I've transcribed it below.

Basically what the e-mail is discussing sounds like a homemade version of or a precursor to
[National Night Out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Night_Out).

This e-mail can be seen in this timestamped video on
[YouTube](https://youtu.be/ic1yuXLQAwo?list=PLC8FcymY6DIdhd3kwW_I-ZANaaR8DCvyO&t=1349).
